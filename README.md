# Clustering Analysis of Knee Osteoarthritis Structural Progression Profiles
## Motivation and rationale  

### The Context:  
Osteoarthritis is a common condition which affects joints creating pain and difficulty in moving, in this I will be focusing on occurrences within the knee joint. It is caused by cartilage breaking down within the joints which can occur from injuries, family history and obesity [1]. Osteo is the most common form of arthritis affecting over 32.5 million adults in the US alone [2]. It is a common condition in the older population because it occurs due to usage and so increasing age means an increased risked of osteoarthritis.  

### The Problem:  
*	Find subtypes of diseases that occur in osteo cohort
*	Osteoarthritis is very common this could  further our understanding  

### My Approach:
For my project I intend to analyse patient progression profiles from a knee osteoarthritis cohort  and find similarities in these profiles, showing distinct subtypes of diseases. To do this I will unify the data from these profiles doing and use a clustering algorithm to group data by similarities. These clusters will show the mentioned subtypes of diseases and how common they are. To make this information understandable I will produce visualisations of the findings from this.  
I aim to do this with the use of Python and its libraries of Pandas and Seaborn, for data analysis and producing graphs respectively. I am using these libraries as I have some experience with both and Seaborn is designed Pandaâ€™s data structures.  

## Aim and objectives  
### Aim: Analyse data from patient progression profiles to find common subtypes of diseases and visualise the findings
### Objectives:
1)	Understand the data present in the progression profiles  
Improving my understanding of what the data in these profiles represents and means will allow me to optimise my research areas. I will complete this objective before I begin to unify the data as otherwise mistakes will likely occur.  
2)	Unify the data from progression profiles  
Combining all of the data from the profiles means I can begin implementing a clustering algorithm and in doing so I will able to further my understanding of the data.   
3)	Explore different clustering algorithms that can be used with the data  
These algorithms will group similar data together showing common occurrences between the progression profiles and trends in the data. (TODO) I have done background research on a selection of algorithms. When testing the algorithms, I will only perform them on a subset of the data to reduce the time needed.  
4)	Group common similarities between profiles using optimal clustering algorithm  
Implementing the optimal clustering algorithm will allow me to quickly and accurately group the data so that informative visualisations can be produced.  
5)	Visualise the similarities in an informative manner  
With the data being clustered I can begin to draw conclusions from the groupings by producing visualisations of the data.
